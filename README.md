# JavaScript quiz app

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "JavaScript quiz app".

It's purpose is to build a quiz game in JavaScript using complex JavaScript concepts.

## Idea

For your JavaScript project, you can build a quiz application that tests the userâ€™s knowledge of JavaScript concepts while also allowing them to practice their HTML and CSS skills. The quiz application will present the user with a series of multiple-choice questions and track their score. You can use asynchronous programming techniques to load the quiz questions from an external API, closures to create private variables and functions that are only accessible within the quiz application, prototypal inheritance to create a Question object that can be reused for each question in the quiz, higher order functions to create utility functions that can be used throughout the quiz application, currying to create a function that can generate a specific type of question, recursion to generate a random set of questions from the API, promises to handle the asynchronous loading of the quiz questions, generators to create a function that can iterate over the quiz questions, event loop to handle user input in the quiz application, type coercion to validate user input, and more. You can find more difficult JavaScript concepts to learn from the links I provided earlier.

## Learning

- JavaScript
- Closures
- Prototypal Inheritance
- Currying
- Promises
- Generators
- Implicit, Explicit, Nominal, Structuring and Duck Typing
- == vs === vs typeof
- setTimeout, setInterval and requestAnimationFrame
- DOM and Layout Trees
- this, call, apply and bind
- Object.create and Object.assign
- map, reduce, filter, sort, find, some, every, findIndex, forEach and other higher-order functions.
- Pure Functions, Side Effects, State Mutation and Event Propagation

## Requirements

- A user must be able to start a quiz about JavaScript concepts.
- A user must be able to start a quiz about HTML concepts.
- A user must be able to start a quiz about CSS concepts.
- A user must have a local high score for each quiz type.
- A user must be able to choose out of different amounts of multiple choice options to answer a question.
- New questions must be easily added to any quiz type.
- A document needs to be present in the repository that briefly explains the complex JavaScript concepts to be used in this project.
